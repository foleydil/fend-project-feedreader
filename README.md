## Overview

This is the "Feed Reader Testing" project, a part of the Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program.

This program is primarily a testing suite through the Jasmine framework, to check the functionality of a Feed Ready application.

To run the program, download zip from GitHub or clone via the terminal using
`git clone https://github.com/foleydil/fend-project-feedreader.git`, and open index.html in a web browser.

## Dependencies

Testing suites require Jasmine-2.1.2. To install via the shell through node.js, run `npm install jasmine`.
Node.js can be installed by following the instructions here: https://nodejs.org/

This program incorporates some JavaScript ES6 elements, and may not work on older browsers or those not compatible with ES6 features.
